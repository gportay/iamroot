== NAME

iamroot - Emulate the syscall chroot(2) for unprivileged processes in userspace

== DESCRIPTION

Only a privileged process can run *chroot(2)*.

*iamroot(7)* intends to emulate the behaviour of the *chroot(2)* syscall for
unprivileged users as far as the permissions grant it; *iamroot(7)* cannot
bypass the permissions such as reading or writing to files that do not belongs
to the user.

*iamroot(7)* consists of an ELF library and a shell script which workaround the
needs for privileges to run processes that call *chroot(2)* and for executables
with the SUID bit set or for not dynamically linked objects.

== PREREQUISITE

A _pathname_ starting with _/_ is called an *absolute* _pathname_; otherwise it
is called a *relative* _pathname_.

Every processes inherits two related path ingredients from its parent:

	- _cwd_ for the current working directory
	- _root_ for the root directory

The _cwd_ can be changed using *chdir(2)* or *fchdir(2)*; the _root_ can be
changed using *chroot(2)*.

Both ingredients are checked in _/proc/<pid>/cwd_ and _/proc/<pid>/root_.

	[gportay@archlinux ~]$ readlink /proc/self/cwd
	/home/gportay
	[gportay@archlinux ~]$ readlink /proc/self/root
	/

See *path_resolution(7)* for a more thorough description of path resolution; in
short, the _root_ is prepended to absolute _pathnames_.

== HOW IT WORKS

The library _libiamroot.so_ is preloaded by *ld.so(8)* using *LD_PRELOAD* and
intercepts the calls to *libc(7)* with a _pathname_ in parameter. It resolves
the _pathname_ internally before calling the real symbol with the _pathname_
modified.

If the process changes the _root_ directory using *chroot(2)*, the library
intercepts the function and does not call the real symbol then. Instead, the
library stores the absolute path of the _pathname_ given in parameter in the
environment *IAMROOT_ROOT*. The library resolves every absolute _pathname_ of
the subsequent intercepted calls using this environment variable.

If the process changes the _current_ working directory using either *chdir(3p)*
or *fchdir(3p)*, the library intercepts these functions as well and it checks
if the process breaks from its "chroot jail". If it exits, the library resets
the environment *IAMROOT_ROOT* and it resolves every absolute _pathname_ of the
subsequent intercepted calls normally.

The library _libiamroot.so_ does not gain the superuser permissions, as a
consequence, the functions can end with _EACCESS_ or _EPERM_ errors. However,
the script _exec.sh_ is run to workaround the impossible; i.e. to handle the
lack of permissions or to handle the binaries which can not support library
preloading (SUID executables or not dynamically linked objects).

*iamroot(7)* was been tested to make minimal linux rootfs with *pacstrap(1)* or
*alpine-make-rootfs*. Nevertheless, it is a proof-of-concept, therefore expect
the unexpectable!

_Note:_ The library _libiamroot.so_ replaces *fakechroot(1)*; but it is not a
replacant for *fakeroot(1)* as it provides a minimal subset of its features.
